# Changelog

All notable changes to CircuitPython Deploy (cpd) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1] - 2025-06-29

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where `--dry-run --backup` would actually create backup files instead of just showing what would be backed up
- Dry-run mode now properly shows "Would create backup at..." without actually creating the backup directory

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-29

### Added
- üöÄ **Initial release** of CircuitPython Deploy (cpd)
- üîç **Automatic board detection** for CircuitPython devices
- üìÅ **Smart file filtering** with .cpdignore support (gitignore-style patterns)
- üíæ **Backup functionality** with automatic directory structure preservation
- üìä **Progress tracking** with visual progress bars using indicatif
- üéØ **Dry-run mode** for safe deployment previewing
- üîß **Cross-platform support** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- üí¨ **Enhanced error messages** with troubleshooting guidance
- ‚ö° **High-performance deployment** (tested: 24 files in 68ms)

### Core Features
- **CLI interface** with comprehensive argument parsing using clap
- **Board management**:
  - Automatic CircuitPython board detection via multiple indicators
  - Volume label reading (Windows/Unix)
  - Interactive board selection for multiple boards
  - Manual board specification support
- **File operations**:
  - Smart file copying with timestamp preservation
  - Directory structure preservation
  - Atomic operations where possible
  - Comprehensive error handling
- **Configuration**:
  - .cpdignore file support with full gitignore syntax
  - Default exclusion patterns for common development files
  - Configurable via command-line arguments

### Technical Implementation
- **Rust-based** for performance and safety
- **Cross-platform** disk enumeration and file operations
- **Robust error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Memory efficient** design for large projects
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 7+ integration tests

### Commands and Options
- `cpd` - Deploy current directory to auto-detected board
- `cpd --list-boards` - Show detected CircuitPython boards
- `cpd --dry-run` - Preview deployment without changes
- `cpd --backup <dir>` - Create backup before deployment
- `cpd --board <path>` - Specify board manually
- `cpd --verbose` - Enable detailed output
- `cpd --yes` - Skip confirmation prompts
- `cpd --force` - Force deployment to non-standard paths

### Supported Platforms
- **Windows** with enhanced volume label detection
- **macOS** with mount point analysis
- **Linux** with comprehensive device detection

### Dependencies
- `clap` 4.5+ - CLI argument parsing
- `sysinfo` 0.35+ - System/disk information
- `walkdir` 2.5+ - Directory traversal
- `ignore` 0.4+ - Pattern matching for ignore files
- `indicatif` 0.17+ - Progress bars
- `winapi` 0.3+ (Windows) - Volume label detection
- `filetime` 0.2+ - Timestamp preservation

### Examples and Documentation
- **Comprehensive README** with quick start guide
- **Example projects** including:
  - Basic LED blink example
  - Advanced sensor dashboard
  - Complete project structure templates
- **Troubleshooting guide** with common solutions
- **Integration examples** for development workflows

### Performance Benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Single file deployment: ~5ms
- ‚úÖ Medium project (6 files): ~15ms  
- ‚úÖ Large project (24 files): ~68ms
- ‚úÖ Real CircuitPython board deployment: Tested and verified
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility: Validated on Windows

### Known Limitations
- Requires CircuitPython firmware (not compatible with MicroPython)
- Board must be accessible as a removable drive
- Some advanced gitignore patterns may not be fully supported

### Future Roadmap
- [ ] Watch mode for automatic deployment on file changes
- [ ] Configuration file support (.cpdconfig)
- [ ] Shell completion scripts
- [ ] Package manager distribution (Homebrew, Chocolatey, etc.)
- [ ] Network deployment over WiFi/Bluetooth
- [ ] Template support for new projects
- [ ] Integration with CircuitPython package managers
